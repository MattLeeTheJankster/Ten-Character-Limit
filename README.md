Grading
-------
Remember the purpose of this unit is to learn git. So of course writing a correct program will be considered in grading, but so will proger git usage, so remember to:
* Update this readme to be useful to your users (including removing this grading info.)
* Make a .gitignore (hint: users don't need your output file. they can make their own.)
* Make commits incrementally as you code. Submittinga  single commit will not earn full credit.
